# AVX_Programing

This program is an AVX (Advanced Vector Extensions) assignment at my university.<br>
The task itself: 

- Load the 2 bitmaps!
- The size of the space_2.bmp bitmap is 1200x1200 pixels, so shrink it to 600x600 by averaging the values horizontally and keeping every other pixel vertically!
- Average every pixel value of the original (600x600 pixels) space_1.bmp and the resized space_2 bitmap, and save the resulting 600x600 bitmap as space_new.bmp!"
